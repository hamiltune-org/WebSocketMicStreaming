1. Added the audio sources to the clients themselves (I forgot to do this in V2)

2. Added a client volume parameter,d efault value of 5 seems good for me.

3. Added a new abstract method, onClose, to WS_Server because in my case I want to 
	destroy gameobjects when I close (Also note important to do this on main thread)
