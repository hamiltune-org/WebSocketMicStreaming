# WebSocketMicStreaming
Some C# and JavaScript source code for streaming microphone audio via WebSockets.

The provided source code is freely available for educational/personal usage, please contact me if you want to use it commercially.

Streaming microphone audio is not easy. These scripts should help provide a clear basis for how audio can be streamed from Microphones using the javascript Web Audio API and sent via WebSockets to tcp servers for processing. The coding was done and is meant to be tested in a Unity3D WebGL environment.
