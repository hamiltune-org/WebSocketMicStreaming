1. Encapsulated Mic stuff into a class that extends server, server is
	now abstract and must have a subclass implement parse and register methods
	
2. The included mic server class now registers clients as a new class,
	myclients. myclients have all of the mic features from v1 but are also tied
	to a gameobject, client id and tcpclient
	
3. I had to change the while (stream.Available) to < 9 in order to work with firefox.
	I guess firefox sends the message meta data first without sending the data? Msglen
	Was wrong and gave an invalid index exception because bytes length was only 8
